# Unearthing Tapajós & Beyond: LiDAR, Crux Alignment Charting the Unknown with Magellan: AI-Assisted Discovery of Ancient Amazonian Settlements

This project explores the potential for uncovering pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon Rainforest by combining remote sensing, GPT-4 vision models, and historical research. Using high-resolution DTM data from OpenTopography and GEDI canopy height information, we analyzed terrain anomalies primarily within the Tapajós region in Brazil — a historically rich but underexplored area — with one key site extending northward into the central Amazon basin.

An automated anomaly detection pipeline was developed that applies DTM normalization, hillshading, percentile-based elevation filtering, and morphological classification to isolate possible anthropogenic features. Each anomaly was then interpreted using GPT-4, which assessed geomorphological form, ecological setting, and contextual archaeological clues to suggest plausible site types.

Five key anomalies were selected for Checkpoint 3 submission:

- A1: Tapajós Platform — large rectangular enclosure (~864,000 m²), GEDI-verified
- A2: Tapajós Round Structure — compact, circular depression with strong DTM signature
- A3: Tapajós Mound Candidate — smaller, dense, rounded mound form
- A4: Tapajós Geometric Candidate — high-convexity geomorphology, likely anthropogenic
- Z-Crux: Northern Cruciform — located outside Tapajós, this GEDI-aligned terrain feature corresponds with Crux constellation azimuths, suggesting ceremonial or cosmographic intent
  
These findings include large-scale raised platforms, round enclosures, and a unique cruciform layout — all bearing resemblance to known pre-Columbian geoglyphs and mound villages across the Amazon. Interpretations are cross-validated against historical records, including Percy Fawcett's expeditions, and modern LiDAR discoveries in Santarém and the Bolivian lowlands.

By integrating modern AI tools, remote sensing, and historical narratives, the custom GPT assistant Magellan (custom GPT ID: gpt-06cf7d96-9a3e-4b25-8610-0f8e41f39a3d) helps generate reproducible site hypotheses and supports deeper archaeological inquiry.
